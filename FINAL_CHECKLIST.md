## 💡 Pro Tips

**If backend is slow on first request:**
- Free tier on Render "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Mention this in email (already included in template)
- Subsequent requests are instant

**If frontend has issues:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is set correctly
- Make sure it ends with `/api`
- Clear browser cache and try again
